# 6.1.3 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/anacrontab
# The /etc/anacrontab file is used by anacron to control its own
# jobs. The commands in this item make sure that root is the user
# and group owner of the file and is the only user that can read
# and write the file.
#
# This file contains information on what system jobs are run by
# anacron. Write access to these files could provide unprivileged
# users with the ability to elevate their privileges. Read access
# to these files could provide users with the ability to gain insight
# on system jobs that run on the system and could provide them a way
# to gain unauthorized privileged access.
file "/etc/anacrontab" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0600
end

# 6.1.4 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/crontab
# The /etc/crontab file is used by cron to control its own jobs.
# The commands in this item make here sure that root is the user
# and group owner of the file and is the only user that can read
# and write the file.
#
# This file contains information on what system jobs are run by
# cron. Write access to these files could provide unprivileged
# users with the ability to elevate their privileges. Read access
# to these files could provide users with the ability to gain insight
# on system jobs that run on the system and could provide them a way
# to gain unauthorized privileged access.
file "/etc/crontab" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0600
end

# 6.1.5 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/cron.hourly
# This directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on
# an hourly basis. The files in this directory cannot be
# manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead edited by
#system administrators using a text editor. The commands below
# restrict read/write and search access to user and group root,
# preventing regular users from accessing this directory.
#
# Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged
# users could provide them the means for gaining unauthorized
# elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory
# could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated
# privileges or circumvent auditing controls.
directory "/etc/cron.hourly" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0700
end

# 6.1.6 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/cron.daily
# The /etc/cron.daily directory contains system cron jobs that
# need to run on a daily basis. The files in this directory
# cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead
# edited by system administrators using a text editor. The
# commands below restrict read/write and search access to user
# and group root, preventing regular users from accessing this
# directory.
#
# Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged
# users could provide them the means for gaining unauthorized
# elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory
# could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain
# elevated privileges or circumvent auditing controls.
directory "/etc/cron.daily" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0700
end

# 6.1.7 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/cron.weekly
# The /etc/cron.weekly directory contains system cron jobs that
# need to run on a weekly basis. The files in this directory
# cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead
# edited by system administrators using a text editor. The
# commands below restrict read/write and search access to
# user and group root, preventing regular users from accessing
# this directory.
#
# Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged
# users could provide them the means for gaining unauthorized
# elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory
# could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated
# privileges or circumvent auditing controls.
directory "/etc/cron.weekly" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0700
end

# 6.1.8 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/cron.monthly
# The /etc/cron.monthly directory contains system cron jobs that
# need to run on a monthly basis. The files in this directory
# cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead
# edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands
# below restrict read/write and search access to user and group
# root, preventing regular users from accessing this directory.
#
# Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged
# users could provide them the means for gaining unauthorized
# elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory
# could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated
# privileges or circumvent auditing controls.
directory "/etc/cron.monthly" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0700
end

# 6.1.9 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/cron.d
# The /etc/cron.d directory contains system cron jobs that need
# to run in a similar manner to the hourly, daily weekly and 
# monthly jobs from /etc/crontab, but require more granular
# control as to when they run. The files in this directory
# cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are 
# instead edited by system administrators using a text
# editor. The commands below restrict read/write and
# search access to user and group root, preventing regular
# users from accessing this directory.
#
# Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged
# users could provide them the means for gaining unauthorized
# elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory
# could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain
# elevated privileges or circumvent auditing controls.
directory "/etc/cron.d" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0700
end

# 6.1.10 Restrict at Daemon
# The at daemon works with the cron daemon to allow
# non-privileged users to submit one time only jobs
# at their convenience. There are two files that
# control at: /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny. If
# /etc/at.allow exists, then users listed in the file
# are the only ones that can create at jobs. If
# /etc/at.allow does not exist and /etc/at.deny
# does exist, then any user on the system, with the
# exception of those listed in /etc/at.deny, are
# allowed to execute at jobs. An empty /etc/at.deny
# file allows any user to create at jobs. If neither
# /etc/at.allow nor /etc/at.deny exist, then only
# superuser can create at jobs. The commands below remove
# the /etc/at.deny file and create an empty /etc/at.allow
# file that can only be read and modified by user and group
# root.
#
# Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users
# could provide them the means to gain unauthorized elevated privileges.
# Granting read access to this directory could give an unprivileged
# user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent
# auditing controls. In addition, it is a better practice to create
# a white list of users who can execute at jobs versus a blacklist of
# users who canâ€™t execute at jobs as a system administrator will always
# know who can create jobs and does not have to worry about remembering
# to add a user to the blacklist when a new user id is created.

# NOTE: Using /etc/at.deny here like solaris and removing /etc/at.allow if exists
file "/etc/at.deny" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0700
end

file "/etc/at.allow" do
  action :delete
end

# 9.1.1 Verify Permissions on /etc/passwd
# The /etc/passwd file contains user account information
# that is used by many system utilities and therefore must
# be readable for these utilities to operate.
#
# It is critical to ensure that the /etc/passwd file is
# protected from unauthorized write access. Although it
# is protected by default, the file permissions could be
# changed either inadvertently or through malicious actions.
#
# 9.1.5 Verify User/Group Ownership on /etc/passwd
# The /etc/passwd file contains a list of all the valid userIDs defined
#  in the system, but not the passwords. The command below sets the owner
# and group of the file to root.
#
# The /etc/passwd file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes
# by non- priliveged users, but needs to be readable as this information
# is used with many non- privileged programs.
file "/etc/passwd" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0644
end

# 9.1.2 Verify Permissions on /etc/shadow
# The /etc/shadow file is used to store the information about
# user accounts that is critical to the security of those accounts,
# such as the hashed password and other security information.
#
# If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they
# can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed
# password to break it. Other security information that is stored
# in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful
# to subvert the user accounts.
#
# 9.1.6 Verify User/Group Ownership on /etc/shadow
# The /etc/shadow file contains the one-way cipher text passwords
# for each user defined in the /etc/passwd file. The command below
# sets the user and group ownership of the file to root.
#
# If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they
# can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed
# password to break it. Other security information that is stored
# in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful
# to subvert the user accounts.
file "/etc/shadow" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0000
end

# 9.1.3 Verify Permissions on /etc/gshadow
# The /etc/gshadow file contains information about group accounts
# that is critical to the security of those accounts, such as the
# hashed password and other security information.
#
# If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/gshadow file, they
# can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed
# password to break it. Other security information that is stored
# in the /etc/gshadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful
# to subvert the group accounts.
#
# 9.1.7 Verify User/Group Ownership on /etc/gshadow
# The /etc/gshadow file contains information about group accounts
# that is critical to the security of those accounts, such as the
# hashed password and other security information.
#
# If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/gshadow file, they
# can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed
# password to break it. Other security information that is stored
# in the /etc/gshadow file (such as expiration) could also be
# useful to subvert the group accounts.
file "/etc/gshadow" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0000
end

# 9.1.4 Verify Permissions on /etc/group
# The /etc/group file contains a list of all the valid groups defined
# in the system. The command below allows read/write access for root
# and read access for everyone else.
#
# The /etc/group file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes
# by non-privileged users, but needs to be readable as this information
# is used with many non-privileged programs.
#
# 9.1.8 Verify User/Group Ownership on /etc/group
# The /etc/group file contains a list of all the valid groups defined
# in the system. The command below allows read/write access for root
# and read access for everyone else.
#
# The /etc/group file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes
# by non-priliveged users, but needs to be readable as this information
# is used with many non-privileged programs.
file "/etc/group" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0644
end

# 9.1.9 Find World Writable Files
# Unix-based systems support variable settings to control access to files.
# World writable files are the least secure. See the chmod(2) man page for
# more information.
#
# Data in world-writable files can be modified and compromised by any user
# on the system. World writable files may also indicate an incorrectly
# written script or program that could potentially be the cause of a larger
# compromise to the system's integrity.
bash "remove_world_writable_flag_from_files" do
  user "root"
  code "for fn in $(df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f -perm -0002);do chmod o-w $fn;done"
  only_if "test -n \"$(df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f -perm -0002)\"", :user => "root" 
end
  
# 9.1.10 Find Un-owned Files and Directories
# Sometimes when administrators delete users from the password file they
# neglect to remove all files owned by those users from the system.
#
# A new user who is assigned the deleted user's user ID or group ID may
# then end up "owning" these files, and thus have more access on the system
# than was intended.
bash "reclaim_ownership_of_orphaned_files_and_dirs" do
  user "root"
  code "for fn in $(df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -nouser -ls | awk '{ printf $11\"\\n\" }'); do chown root:root $fn;done"

end
  
  
# 9.1.11 Find Un-grouped Files and Directories
# Sometimes when administrators delete users from the password file they
# neglect to remove all files owned by those users from the system.

end
  
# 9.2.1 Ensure Password Fields are Not Empty
# An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as
# that user without providing a password.  
#
# All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from
# being used by an unauthorized user.
bash "no_empty_passwd_fields" do
  user "root"
  code "for user in $(/bin/cat /etc/shadow | /bin/awk -F: '($2 == \"\")' | cut -d':' -f1 $1);do /usr/bin/passwd -l $user;done"

end

# 9.2.2 Verify No Legacy "+" Entries Exist in /etc/passwd File
# The character + in various files used to be markers for systems
#  to insert data from NIS maps at a certain point in a system
# configuration file. These entries are no longer required on 
# RHEL6/CentOS 6 systems, but may exist in files that have been
# imported from other platforms.

end

# 9.2.5 Verify No UID 0 Accounts Exist Other Than root
# Any account with UID 0 has superuser privileges on the system.
#
# This access must be limited to only the default root account
# and only from the system console. Administrative access must
# be through an unprivileged account using an approved mechanism
# as noted in Item 7.5 Restrict root Login to System Console.
bash "no UID 0 except root account exists" do
  user "root"
  code "for acct in $(/bin/cat /etc/passwd | /bin/awk -F: '($3 == 0) { print $1 }' | grep -v \"root\"); do sed -i \"/^$acct:/ d\" /etc/passwd;done"

end

# 9.2.6 Ensure root PATH Integrity
# The root user can execute any command on the
# system and could be fooled into executing programs
# unemotionally if the PATH is not set correctly.
#
# Including the current working directory (.) or
# other writable directory in root's executable
# path makes it likely that an attacker can gain
# superuser access by forcing an administrator
# operating as root to execute a Trojan horse program.
